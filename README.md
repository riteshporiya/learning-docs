# SOLID Principles 🌟

Welcome to the SOLID Principles repository! Here, you'll find detailed explanations and code examples for understanding and applying the SOLID principles in your software development journey.

## What are the SOLID Principles? 🤔

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that can help you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.

Here are the SOLID principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 🕊️**: A class should have only one reason to change.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 🚪**: Software entities (classes, modules, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 🔄**: Objects of derived classes should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting program correctness.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 🏗️**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 🔄**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details.
